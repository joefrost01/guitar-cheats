# Andrew Smith (Boxer Rebellion - "The Cold Still" Era)

## üî• 30-SECOND WIN: Atmospheric delay-drenched arpeggios with sparse, impactful chord work

## üé∏ Brief Bio
Andrew Smith crafted Boxer Rebellion's distinctive guitar sound during "The Cold Still" era with his atmospheric, textural approach that emphasizes space, subtlety, and emotional resonance. His playing, especially on tracks like "The Runner," combines minimalist arpeggio patterns, strategic use of delay and reverb, dynamic restraint, and an approach that prioritizes serving the song's emotional core over technical flash.

## üìä Technique Difficulty Scale
| ‚≠ê | Very Easy | Instant results with minimal practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Easy | Achievable in one short practice session |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Moderate | Might take a few days to get comfortable |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Challenging | Worth the effort but requires dedicated practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Advanced | Signature technique requiring more time |

## üöÄ Fast-Track Techniques
- **Atmospheric Arpeggios** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Sparse, carefully chosen notes with generous space
- **Delay-Enhanced Patterns** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Simple patterns made complex through delay effects
- **Dynamic Restraint** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Controlled, minimalist playing that builds tension
- **Textural Chord Work** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Using chord voicings as texture rather than rhythm
- **Strategic Note Choice** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Selecting specific notes from scales for maximum emotional impact

## ‚öôÔ∏è Your Gear Settings
- **Fender 52 Vintage Hotrod Tele or Gibson ES-339**: Both would work well for his tone
- **Marshall DSL1**: Clean to edge-of-breakup (2-4)
- **DD-200 Delay**: Primary effect - multiple rhythmic delays (dotted eighth + quarter)
- **BlueSky Reverb**: Medium to large hall/plate settings for atmosphere
- **Timmy**: Very light overdrive for subtle warmth
- **CKK Robot Phaser**: Subtle settings for specific textures

## üì± Instant Smith Setting
- Clean to edge-of-breakup tone
- Moderate delay with multiple repeats (35-40% mix)
- Generous reverb (hall setting)
- Balanced EQ (neutral, not too bright or dark)
- Neck or middle pickup for warmth
- Focus on picking dynamics over gain

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Basic atmospheric arpeggio patterns with delay
2. **Day 3**: Add dynamic control and textural chord voicings
3. **Day 7**: Practice integrating effects with playing technique
4. **Day 14**: Combine all elements with Smith's restrained, emotional approach

## ‚ö° Cross-Artist Techniques
- **Textural Approach**: Similar to The Edge but more restrained and intimate
- **Arpeggio Focus**: Shares DNA with Radiohead's Ed O'Brien but sparser
- **Atmospheric Effects**: Like Explosions in the Sky but more song-focused

## üéÆ Visual Learning
**Arpeggio Spacing Pattern:**
‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ... (deliberate, even spacing with room for delay)

**Dynamic Flow Concept:**
tension ‚Üí micro-release ‚Üí tension ‚Üí RELEASE (controlled build and release cycle)

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Delay Timing** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice playing in perfect time with delay repeats
- **Dynamic Control** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice extremely subtle variations in picking attack
- **Space Appreciation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice leaving deliberate spaces between notes for delay to fill

## ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Andrew Smith Hacks
1. **Delay-Driven Patterns** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use delay to create complexity from simple patterns
2. **Strategic Silence** ‚≠ê: Embrace space between notes as part of your playing
3. **Arpeggiated Approach** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Break chords into carefully chosen arpeggios
4. **Minimal Gain** ‚≠ê: Keep drive very subtle - focus on dynamics instead
5. **Reverb Depth** ‚≠ê: Use generous reverb to add dimension
6. **Patient Building** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Build intensity gradually through repetition rather than sudden changes
7. **Textural Awareness** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Think in terms of creating soundscapes rather than traditional lead/rhythm
8. **Extended Chords** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use maj7, sus2, and other colorful voicings for emotional resonance

## üéß Listening Recommendations ("The Cold Still" Era)
- **"The Runner"**: Quintessential example of his atmospheric, building style
- **"Step Out of the Car"**: Showcases his textural approach and restraint
- **"Cause for Alarm"**: Demonstrates his dynamic control and emotional expressiveness

## ‚öôÔ∏è Delay Settings For "The Runner"
For authentic Smith-style delayed arpeggios:
- **Primary Delay**: Dotted eighth notes (~350-375ms), 3-4 repeats, 35% mix
- **Secondary Delay**: Quarter notes (~250ms), 2-3 repeats, 25% mix
- This creates a rhythmic cascade effect while maintaining clarity

## üé∏ Key Aspects of "The Runner"
- Focus on spacious, carefully chosen notes with room to breathe
- Gradual build from sparse arpeggios to more intense chord work
- Delay as an integral part of the composition, not just an effect
- Restraint throughout, even during the climactic sections
- Seamless integration with bass and drums for a cohesive sonic landscape
