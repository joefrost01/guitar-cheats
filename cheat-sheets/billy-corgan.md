# Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins)

## üî• 30-SECOND WIN: Play the "Cherub Rock" riff with heavy fuzz and let it ring

## üé∏ Brief Bio
Billy Corgan is known for huge, layered guitar sounds, fuzz-drenched riffs, and distinctive melodic sensibilities. His playing often combines massive power chords, dreamy atmospheric layers, and deceptively simple yet emotionally resonant solos.

## üöÄ Signature Techniques
- **Massive Power-Chord Riffs**: Alternate between loud fuzz power chords and quiet palm-muted sections for dramatic contrast.
- **Octave Layers**: Add octaves above or below power chords for richer texture.
- **Drone Notes**: Let open strings resonate to create instant depth without complicated fingerings.
- **Minimalist Soloing**: Simple, emotive solos with slow, expressive bends.


## üìä Technique Difficulty Scale
| ‚≠ê | Very Easy | Instant results with minimal practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Easy | Achievable in one short practice session |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Moderate | Might take a few days to get comfortable |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Challenging | Worth the effort but requires dedicated practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Advanced | Signature technique requiring more time |

## üöÄ Fast-Track Techniques
- **Massive Power-Chord Riffs** ‚≠ê: Alternate between loud fuzz power chords and quiet palm-muted sections. Zero skill required - just use heavy distortion!
- **Octave Layers** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Skip a string and play notes 2 frets apart for instant thickness (e.g., 7th fret A string + 9th fret G string)
- **Drone Notes** ‚≠ê: Let open strings ring with power chords for instant depth without complicated fingerings
- **Simple Repetition** ‚≠ê: Play the same short melodic line repeatedly, gradually getting louder
- **Pick Scrapes & Noise Swells** ‚≠ê: Drag pick along wound strings for dramatic effect (zero skill required!)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Your Gear Settings
- **Marshall DSL1**: Set Gain around 6‚Äì7, Treble 6, Mids 4‚Äì5, Bass 6
- **Big Muff**: Sustain (Fuzz) around 7‚Äì8, Tone around 5, for thick, saturated fuzz
- **BlueSky**: Plate reverb, moderate decay for subtle atmosphere
- **DD-200 Delay**: Short delay, moderate feedback for spacious sound

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Heavy power chords with fuzz (Cherub Rock riff) - focus on letting notes ring out
2. **Day 3**: Add octave technique to simple riffs (use 7th fret A string + 9th fret G string pattern)
3. **Day 7**: Incorporate drone notes and open strings for atmosphere with clean/dirty dynamics
4. **Day 14**: Begin working on minimal, emotional soloing with simple string bends

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Dynamic Contrast Exercise**: Practice transitioning quickly between soft, clean arpeggios and heavy, distorted power chords using the same progression.
- **Layered Riff Building**: Create a simple one-string riff, then practice adding octaves and harmonies one layer at a time.

## ‚ö° Cross-Artist Techniques
- **Fuzz Mastery**: Also works with Josh Homme and J Mascis styles
- **Power Chord Dynamics**: Shared with Kurt Cobain and Malcolm Young approaches
- **Octave Technique**: Similar to Jack White's approach but with more sustain
