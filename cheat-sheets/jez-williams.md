- Balanced EQ with slight mid-scoop
- Subtle compression for consistency
- Effects as integral parts of the sound, not just additions

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Basic delayed arpeggio patterns with standard tuning
2. **Day 3**: Add alternative tunings (DADGAD) and textural chord shapes
3. **Day 7**: Practice atmospheric techniques and effect manipulation
4. **Day 14**: Combine all elements with Williams' rhythmic and melodic sensibility

**Delay-Enhanced Pattern:**
‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ...‚ñÆ... (even spacing with delay filling the gaps)

**Textural Building Blocks:**
Arpeggio ‚Üí Delay ‚Üí Reverb ‚Üí Ambient Layer (building atmosphere in stages)

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Delay Timing** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice playing precisely in time with dotted eighth delay patterns
- **DADGAD Exploration** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice finding chord shapes and patterns in DADGAD tuning
- **Ambient Technique** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice creating textural sounds using volume swells and effects

## ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Jez Williams Hacks
1. **Dotted Eighth Delay** ‚≠ê: Set delay to dotted eighth note timing for instant Doves vibe
2. **DADGAD Tuning** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Retune to DADGAD (D-A-D-G-A-D) for open, atmospheric sounds
3. **High Chord Voicings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use chord shapes that incorporate higher strings for jangle
4. **Layered Effects** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Combine delay, reverb, and subtle modulation
5. **Rhythmic Precision** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Focus on tight, consistent rhythm for driving sections
6. **Ambient Swells** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use volume knob or pedal for gradual note attacks
7. **Melodic Focus** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Craft memorable melodic patterns even in textural parts
8. **Dynamics Contrast** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Alternate between quiet, atmospheric sections and driving moments
