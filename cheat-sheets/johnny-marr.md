## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Chord Voicings
Johnny Marr often uses these distinctive voicings:

**F#m7**: 2x222x  
**Bm7**: x24232  
**Cadd9**: x32033  
**Esus4**: 022200  
**G6**: 320030  
**Dsus2/F#**: 2x023x

## üîç Special Techniques

### Open D6 Tuning (used on "The Headmaster Ritual")
- **Tuning**: DADGBE (only the 5th string changed from A to G)
- **Key chord shape**: xx0780

### Nashville Tuning Trick
For studio layering, Marr sometimes used "Nashville tuning" - replacing the lower 4 strings with thinner gauge strings tuned an octave higher. You can simulate this effect by playing only on the top 2-3 strings.
