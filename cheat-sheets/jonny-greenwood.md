# Jonny Greenwood (Radiohead)

## üî• 30-SECOND WIN: Aggressive strumming of unusual chord voicings with abrupt dynamic shifts

## üé∏ Brief Bio
Jonny Greenwood has redefined modern rock guitar through his experimental approach, combining unconventional techniques, innovative effects usage, and classically-influenced sensibilities. His style evolved from the aggressive alt-rock of early Radiohead to the more textural, abstract, and orchestral approaches of their later work, always prioritizing sonic innovation and emotional impact over conventional technique.

## üìä Technique Difficulty Scale

| ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Easy | Achievable in one short practice session |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Moderate | Might take a few days to get comfortable |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Challenging | Worth the effort but requires dedicated practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Advanced | Signature technique requiring more time |

## üöÄ Fast-Track Techniques
- **Unusual Chord Voicings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Non-standard chord shapes that create harmonic tension
- **Aggressive Strumming Bursts** ‚≠ê: Sudden, violent strumming attacks for dramatic effect
- **Creative Effects Usage** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Experimental approach to pedal combinations and settings
- **Textural Noise** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Creating controlled noise elements as textural components
- **Dramatic Dynamic Shifts** ‚≠ê: Quick transitions between very quiet and very loud

## ‚öôÔ∏è Your Gear Settings
- **Fender 52 Vintage Hotrod Tele**: Perfect for his aggressive early work, cutting attack
- **Gibson ES-339**: Great for moodier, more textural playing
- **Marshall DSL1**: Varying settings from clean (2-3) to overdriven (5-6)
- **Green Russian Big Muff**: Key for "Paranoid Android" style fuzz (sustain 7-8)
- **Frazz Dazzler**: Alternative fuzz option for different textures
- **Timmy**: Light drive for more restrained moments
- **DD-200 Delay**: Ranging from subtle to extreme settings, often with high feedback
- **BlueSky Reverb**: Various settings from subtle to cavernous
- **CKK Robot Phaser**: For specific textural moments
- **Zuul+**: Helpful for controlling noise during dynamic shifts

## üì± Instant Greenwood Setting
- Multiple gain stages available (clean to fuzzy)
- Effects ready to engage/disengage suddenly
- Quick access to extreme dynamic shifts
- Bridge pickup for aggressive parts, neck for mellower textures
- Prepare for sudden playing style changes

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Basic unusual chord shapes with aggressive strumming approach
2. **Day 3**: Add sudden dynamic shifts and simple noise textures
3. **Day 7**: Practice effect combinations and manipulations
4. **Day 14**: Combine all elements with dramatic expression and textural focus

## ‚ö° Cross-Artist Techniques
- **Noise Elements**: Similar to Kevin Shields but more controlled and compositional
- **Unusual Voicings**: Shares DNA with Johnny Marr but more abstract
- **Effects Experimentation**: Like The Edge but more radical and unpredictable

## üéÆ Visual Learning
**Dynamic Contrast Pattern:**
pianissimo ‚Üí FORTISSIMO ‚Üí pianissimo (extreme volume shifts)

**Textural Approach:**
Think in sound layers rather than traditional lead or rhythm roles

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Unusual Chord Voicings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice alternative fingerings for common chords
- **Dynamic Control** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice extreme shifts from very soft to very aggressive playing
- **Effect Manipulation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice changing effect parameters mid-performance

## ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Jonny Greenwood Hacks
1. **Aggressive Attack** ‚≠ê: Sudden bursts of violent strumming
2. **Non-Standard Tunings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Try EAEGBE tuning (drop 4th string to E)
3. **Partial Chords** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Play fragments of chords rather than full voicings
4. **Controlled Feedback** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use feedback as a compositional element
5. **Effect Combinations** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Layer multiple effects for unique textures
6. **Rhythmic Variations** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Sudden shifts in rhythmic patterns
7. **Noise as Texture** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Incorporate controlled noise as musical element
8. **Dramatic Pauses** ‚≠ê: Use silence as dramatically as sound

## üéß Listening Recommendations
- **"Paranoid Android"**: Showcases multiple playing styles and dramatic shifts
- **"Street Spirit (Fade Out)"**: Hypnotic arpeggiated patterns
- **"Creep"**: Famous for the explosive guitar hits in the chorus

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Chord Voicings
Greenwood often uses these unusual voicings:

**Emaj7#11**: 032200  
**Amsus4**: x02230  
**F#m11**: 242222  
**Gsus2/B**: x2000x

## üé∏ Special Techniques

### Thom Yorke Tuning (used on many songs)
- **Tuning**: EAEGBE (only the D string is changed to E)

### Radio Manipulation
For true experimentation, try running your guitar through a small radio with the tuner frequency adjusted for interesting interference patterns.
