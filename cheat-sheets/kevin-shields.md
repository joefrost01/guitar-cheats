# Kevin Shields (My Bloody Valentine)

## üî• 30-SECOND WIN: Tremolo arm "glide guitar" with reverb and fuzz

## üé∏ Brief Bio
Kevin Shields pioneered the "glide guitar" technique as the architect of My Bloody Valentine's distinctive shoegaze sound. His approach combines extreme tremolo arm manipulation, reverse reverb, heavy distortion, and unconventional tunings to create swirling, ethereal textures that often sound more like a synthesizer than a guitar.

## üìä Technique Difficulty Scale
| ‚≠ê | Very Easy | Instant results with minimal practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Easy | Achievable in one short practice session |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Moderate | Might take a few days to get comfortable |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Challenging | Worth the effort but requires dedicated practice |
| ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Advanced | Signature technique requiring more time |

## üöÄ Fast-Track Techniques
- **Glide Guitar** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Hold chords while gently manipulating tremolo arm for pitch bending
- **Reverse Reverb Simulation** ‚≠ê: Heavy reverb with volume swells for reverse-like effects
- **Layered Fuzz** ‚≠ê: Stacking distortion/fuzz for wall of sound textures
- **Unconventional Tunings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Simple alternate tunings for unique chord voicings
- **Strumming Through Effects** ‚≠ê: Simple strumming patterns made ethereal through effects chains

## ‚öôÔ∏è Your Gear Settings
- **Sire S7 Strat**: Ideal for tremolo arm techniques (if it has a tremolo)
- **Marshall DSL1**: Medium gain (5-6), treble and bass balanced (5-6), mids scooped slightly (4)
- **Green Russian Big Muff**: Maximum sustain for wall of sound textures
- **BlueSky Reverb**: Hall setting with long decay, 100% wet for certain parts
- **DD-200 Delay**: Long delay times with moderate feedback
- **Frazz Dazzler**: Layer with Big Muff for extreme textures
- **CKK Robot Phaser**: Slow, deep setting for swirling textures

## üì± Instant Shields Setting
- Medium-high gain with layered fuzz (stack your Frazz Dazzler and Big Muff at lower settings)
- Maximum reverb (BlueSky on hall setting)
- Strat's tremolo arm loosened for easy manipulation
- Slow phaser or deep chorus underneath
- Delay with modulation if available

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Basic tremolo arm bending with clean chords and reverb
2. **Day 3**: Add fuzz/distortion and practice volume swells
3. **Day 7**: Experiment with layered effects and simple alternate tunings
4. **Day 14**: Combine all techniques with precise tremolo control

*Play Em chord and gently manipulate tremolo arm while strumming. Add reverb.*

*Play with heavy fuzz and reverb. Let notes sustain and blend together.*

## ‚ö° Cross-Artist Techniques
- **Wall of Sound Textures**: Similar approach to Billy Corgan but more atmospheric
- **Effect Layering**: Like The Edge but with focus on blur rather than clarity
- **Noise Elements**: Shares experimental approach with Sonic Youth and J Mascis

## üéÆ Visual Learning
**Tremolo Arm Movement:**
Small, gentle movements (¬±¬Ω step pitch bend)

**Effect Stacking Order:**
Guitar ‚Üí Fuzz ‚Üí Phaser ‚Üí Delay ‚Üí Reverb (classic Shields chain)

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Tremolo Control** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice maintaining pitch with tremolo arm while strumming
- **Effect Blending** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice balancing multiple effects without creating mud
- **Volume Swells** ‚≠ê: Practice rolling volume knob from 0 to 10 after striking chords

## ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Kevin Shields Hacks
1. **Loose Tremolo Arm** ‚≠ê: Loosen your trem arm for easier "floating" manipulation
2. **Reverb Before Distortion** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Try placing reverb before fuzz for extreme wash effects
3. **Simple Alternate Tunings** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Drop D or DADGAD for instant drone capabilities
4. **Pick Scrapes Through Effects** ‚≠ê: Simple pick scrapes become otherworldly through effects chain
5. **Double-Tracked Simulation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Use delay with very short time and no feedback to simulate doubled parts
6. **Feedback Control** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Position guitar to create controlled feedback at specific pitches
7. **Chord Simplicity** ‚≠ê: Focus on simple dyads and triads for clearer effect textures
8. **Slow Strumming** ‚≠ê: Let each chord fully develop through the effects chain

## üéß Listening Recommendations
- **"Only Shallow" (Loveless)**: Classic example of glide guitar technique
- **"To Here Knows When" (Loveless)**: Showcases extreme reverse reverb effects
- **"Sometimes" (Loveless)**: Beautiful tremolo arm chord work with clarity
- **"Soon" (Loveless)**: Demonstrates rhythmic elements within texture

## ‚öôÔ∏è Gear Considerations
1. **Tremolo Setup**: If using Sire S7, ensure tremolo arm moves freely but holds tuning
2. **Fuzz Layering**: Try Green Russian Big Muff first, then Frazz Dazzler at lower gain
3. **BlueSky Settings**: Hall mode, long decay, high mix for classic Shields wash
4. **Pickup Selection**: Neck pickup for warmer texture, bridge for more definition
