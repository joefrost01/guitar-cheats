# Matt Bellamy (Muse - Origin of Symmetry & Absolution)

## üî• 30-SECOND WIN: Heavy riff with fuzz and dramatic pitch slides

## üé∏ Brief Bio
Matt Bellamy's guitar work on "Origin of Symmetry" (2001) and "Absolution" (2003) showcases his distinctive blend of classical influences, heavy riffs, and innovative techniques. This era represents his most guitar-focused work, combining aggressive fuzz tones, unconventional chord voicings, dramatic pitch slides, and creative use of effects before the band's later electronic evolution.

- Tight noise gating for precision in heavy riffs

## üîÑ Progression Path
1. **Day 1**: Basic power chord riffs with heavy fuzz ("Plug In Baby" style)
2. **Day 3**: Add pitch slides and dramatic position shifts
3. **Day 7**: Practice simple arpeggios with classical feel
4. **Day 14**: Incorporate harmonic minor scale runs and basic tapping

## ‚ö° Cross-Artist Techniques
- **Fuzz Tones**: Similar to early Jack White but with more precision
- **Classical Influence**: Unique to Bellamy but with some parallels to Randy Rhoads
- **Effect Use**: More controlled version of Kevin Shields' wall of sound
- **Octave Riffs**: Some similarity to Homme's approach but more classical-influenced

## üéÆ Visual Learning
**Dramatic Pitch Slide:**
‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ/‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ\‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ‚ñÆ (steady ‚Üí slide up ‚Üí slide down)

**Classical Arpeggio Flow:**
Low ‚Üí High ‚Üí Low (flowing motion across strings)

## ‚ö° Practice Exercises
- **Harmonic Minor Scale** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice E harmonic minor (E-F#-G-A-B-C-D#-E) for Spanish flavor
- **Position Shifting** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice quick shifts between neck positions while maintaining rhythm
- **Controlled Fuzz Dynamics** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice balancing heavy fuzz with articulation clarity
- **Tapping Exercise** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê: Practice simple hammer-on/pull-off sequences adding tapped notes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Easy Matt Bellamy Hacks
1. **Octave Pedal Substitute** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: If you don't have a dedicated octave pedal, play octaves manually
2. **Drama Through Slides** ‚≠ê: Simple power chord slides create instant tension
3. **Classical Arpeggios** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Focus on smooth, connected notes rather than speed
4. **Artificial Harmonics** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Touch string lightly 12 frets above fretted note for harmonic
5. **High Register Runs** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Play melodic lines high on the neck for Bellamy-esque sound
6. **Tremolo Picking** ‚≠ê‚≠ê: Fast picking on single notes for intensity (Time Is Running Out)
7. **Pedal Tone Riffs** ‚≠ê: Use open low E string as pedal tone beneath changing higher notes
8. **Delay Timing** ‚≠ê: Set delay to match song tempo for rhythmic enhancement

## üéß Listening Recommendations (Origin of Symmetry & Absolution Only)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technique Spotlight: Harmonic Minor Scale
The harmonic minor scale (Bellamy's favorite) creates that Spanish/classical sound:
1. Root (example: E)
2. Whole step (F#)
3. Half step (G)
4. Whole step (A)
5. Whole step (B)
6. Half step (C)
7. Whole and half step (D#)
8. Root (E)

This creates the distinctive classical sound heard in "Plug In Baby" and many other Muse tracks.
